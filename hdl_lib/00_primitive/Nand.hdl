-- NAND gate: the fundamental building block
-- This is the ONLY primitive - all other gates are built from this
-- In hardware, this would be implemented with transistors

entity Nand is
  port(
    a : in bit;
    b : in bit;
    y : out bit
  );
end entity;

architecture primitive of Nand is
begin
  -- Built-in primitive: y = NOT(a AND b)
  y <= not (a and b);
end architecture;
